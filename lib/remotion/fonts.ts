/**
 * Self-hosted webfonts, organised as FONT PACKS (copilot.md §4.7):
 *
 *   - editorial (default): Bricolage Grotesque / Instrument Sans / Space Mono
 *     — the type system from the redesign reference.
 *   - classic:   Fraunces (serif display) / Instrument Sans / Space Mono
 *     — documentary/history feel.
 *   - tech:      Space Grotesk / Inter / JetBrains Mono
 *     — technical/data-heavy feel.
 *
 * The three roles are exposed under stable ALIAS family names ("Explainer
 * Display" etc.), and the active pack decides which woff2 files those aliases
 * resolve to. That keeps every component's font stack (theme.tsx) untouched
 * when the pack changes — the swap happens entirely in @font-face.
 *
 * Self-hosted, not fetched from Google Fonts: the render host has no reliable
 * internet guarantee, and a network font fetch during render is exactly the
 * kind of non-determinism (FOUT / hung request) to avoid. Licenses are OFL —
 * see FONTS_LICENSES.md. Faces are registered TWO ways for robustness:
 *
 *   1. an injected `@font-face` stylesheet, so the faces are declared and
 *      applied by the browser exactly like any CSS webfont; and
 *   2. an explicit `document.fonts.load()` per face inside <FontLoader>,
 *      gated behind a delayRender handle CREATED IN THE RENDER LIFECYCLE
 *      (useState initializer) so Chromium doesn't capture a frame before the
 *      glyphs are ready — a module-scope delayRender does NOT reliably clear
 *      the handle the renderer is actually waiting on.
 *
 * Font loading NEVER blocks or fails a render: a hard safety timeout always
 * clears the handle, and the CSS stacks in theme.tsx all carry a system-font
 * fallback, so a slow/missing face degrades gracefully.

 * Maths glyph fallback. The bundled faces are LATIN-ONLY subsets: none of them
 * carries π, θ, Δ, √, ≤, ∞, →, ℒ, ∫ or ∑. Those glyphs have only ever survived
 * because Chromium silently fell through to a host font — which means the maths
 * has been rendering in whatever the render machine happened to install, and
 * would land as tofu boxes on a host with no symbol font (a Linux render
 * container).
 *
 * Appending this to every maths font stack makes that fallback explicit and
 * ordered: Cambria Math and Segoe UI Symbol both ship with Windows and both
 * cover the full operator/greek range; DejaVu Sans is the usual Linux
 * equivalent; `serif` is the last resort.
 *
 * NOTE: this is a font STACK, not a bundled file — a render host with none of
 * these installed still shows tofu. Bundling a subset of a math face is the
 * permanent fix if rendering ever moves off Windows.
