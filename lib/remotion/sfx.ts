/**
 * The explainer's sound design layer. A small procedurally-generated library
 * (public/sfx, see scripts/gen-sfx.ts) gives the edit physical feedback:
 * flights whoosh past and punchlines hit with a stamp or a soft chime.
 * Everything is mixed WELL below the narration (1.3) and above the music bed
 * (~0.09) so the voice always leads.
 *
 * NOTE: the old per-bullet "pop" and per-tick sounds were deliberately
 * removed — a chirp on every point that lands read as cheap/noisy against the
 * clean editorial look. Text now animates silently; only camera flights and
 * punchlines carry sound. The pop and tick entries below are kept in the
 * library (harmless, unused) so the type/table stay in sync with gen-sfx.ts.
 *
 * All cues render through <SfxCue>, which mounts a <Sequence> only around the
 * sound's own few-second window — a 20-scene journey never has more than a
 * couple of audio tags active on any frame.
